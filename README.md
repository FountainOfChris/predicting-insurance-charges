# Predicting Insurance Charges

## Project Description

Step into the role of a Data Scientist at a leading Health Insurance company, where your task is to build a model that predicts customer charges. This project goes beyond model creation; you'll also test its effectiveness on data from new clients. It's an exciting opportunity to see data science in action in the business world. Dive in and prepare to make a significant impact!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Python programming and data science libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
- Familiarity with regression models and evaluation metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predicting-insurance-charges.git
    cd predicting-insurance-charges
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about customers and their insurance charges. It includes features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.

## Data Preparation

1. **Load Data:** Load the dataset using pandas.
2. **Clean Data:** Handle missing values and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Encode categorical variables, create new features, and scale numerical features as needed.

## Model Building

1. **Feature Selection:** Select the relevant features that will be used to train the model.
2. **Model Training:** Train a regression model using the selected features. Common models include Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model parameters to improve performance.

## Model Testing

1. **Test Data:** Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new data.
2. **Evaluation Metrics:** Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the model's performance.

## Results

Document the results of your model, including the evaluation metrics and any visualizations that help interpret the model's performance.

## Usage

To use the model to predict insurance charges for new clients, follow the instructions provided in the notebook `predicting_insurance_charges_notebook.ipynb`.

1. **Load Model:** Load the trained model.
2. **Input Data:** Provide the new client data as input to the model.
3. **Predict Charges:** Generate predictions for the insurance charges.
